# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Duplicated Stylesheets, think about how to merge the objects containig the styles
2. Don't name components and files after the user story they are related to. Instead, describe what they do. Example: U1CategoryList.js => HomeScreen.js / Home.js
3. Remove unused code, imports, console.logs and comments
4. Although it can be helpful to add comments to a codebase, don't do it too much or on code that does not need an explanation.
